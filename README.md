This is about an A/B test to see if the average of ratings for the highly discounted products is actually better than the average for the other products.

I didn't do much analysis, just to see that the column was complete. then I proceed to define the 2 group based on the median value of the discount and then I have found the average ratings for each group. 
The absolute numbers are quite similar as the 2 groups have an average rating of 4.07 and 4.13 respectively withh variances of 0.071 and 0.096. 

###So can we say that the ratings for the products with bigger discount are actually better?
